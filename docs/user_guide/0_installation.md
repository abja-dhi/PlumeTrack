Plume Track requires Python 3.9 for the backend. However, the Python tool is embedded in the package, so users do not need to install Python separately. 

In order to install Plume Track, activate Administrator privileges on your machine and run the `setup.exe` file located in the root directory of the package. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.

After the installation is complete, you can launch Plume Track from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut.

## File Format
Plume Track uses a specific file extension as input: `.mtproj`. This file format is used to store project configurations and data necessary for Plume Track to function correctly. It is recommended to assign Plume Track as the default application for opening `.mtproj`. In order to do so, open Windows Settings and navigate to `Apps > Default apps`. Type `.mtproj` in the search bar and click on `Choose a default`. In the pop-up window, select Plume Track from the list of applications.
